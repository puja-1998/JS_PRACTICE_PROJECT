Project Description

The Book App allows users to:

1. View a list of books with details such as the book title, author, and description.
2. Add new books by filling in a form with book details.
3. Remove books from the list.

The app uses local storage to store book data, so even after refreshing the page, users can still see the same list of books they added before.

The project was built with an emphasis on vanilla JavaScript, focusing on DOM manipulation, handling user input, and using the browser's local storage API to persist data.

Technologies Used

1. HTML: Used to create the structure of the app.
2. CSS: Used for styling and creating a visually appealing layout.
3. JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity and handling data storage using local storage.

Features

1. View Books: A list of books is displayed on the app, showing the title, author, and description.
2. Add Books: Users can add new books by filling out a form with the book's title, author, and description.
3. Delete Books: Each book in the list has a delete button to remove it from the list.
4. Persistence with Local Storage: All book data is stored in local storage, which means that the books remain in the list even after the browser window is closed or the page is reloaded.
